# PilotProject
SCS Team Repo
This is a test file created by Taz to see what the hell GitHub is and how it works... I really have no clue but it looks quite simple. 
Main - is the original master files
Branches are for testing changes before we commit them
Once committed they then become the new Master - easy peasy lemon squeezy!!!
Always create a new branch when testing!!!!!!! 
Then when happy it all works you can commit.
